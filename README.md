# Project Eidolon

### Overview

The core idea is to create a platform for managing various articles across different industries. Companies should have the availability to define and configure their own articles as these can vary significantly between industries. 

This case includes defining additional fields specific to their needs, on all articles, individual, or groups of articles.

On the other side, we have the shop floor where these articles are produced. Here, the focus is on providing a user-friendly interface for operators to efficiently manage and track the production of these articles.

### The Story

This repo will be divided into various branches, each representing a different chapter of the story. Each chapter will introduce new features, challenges, and solutions as we progress through the development of the project. Starting from a very basic setup, we will gradually build up the complexity and functionality of the application. To include the tool only when needed, each chapter will be merged into the main branch upon completion. This way, the main branch will always represent the current state of the project, while the individual branches will serve as a record of our journey through the development process.
